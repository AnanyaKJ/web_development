# web_development
This repository contains a variety of web development projects where I've been practicing and improving my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and different frameworks. Each project demonstrates different elements of web design, front-end and back-end development, and responsive design. Feel free to explore the code and read the documentation.
